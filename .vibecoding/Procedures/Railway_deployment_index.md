railway environment staging
railway up

# Test thoroughly
curl https://staging-app.railway.app/health

# If good, deploy to production
railway environment production
railway up

# Monitor production
railway logs --follow
```

### Canary Deployments:

```bash
# Deploy new version with limited traffic
# Use Railway replicas feature
railway up --replicas=1  # New version

# Monitor for issues
railway logs --follow

# If good, scale up
railway up --replicas=3

# Gradually increase traffic
```

### Feature Flags:

```javascript
// feature-flags.js
const features = {
  newFeature: process.env.ENABLE_NEW_FEATURE === 'true',
  betaAccess: process.env.ENABLE_BETA === 'true'
};

export function isFeatureEnabled(feature) {
  return features[feature] || false;
}

// Usage
if (isFeatureEnabled('newFeature')) {
  // New code path
} else {
  // Old code path
}
