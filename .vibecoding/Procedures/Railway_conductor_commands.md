4. Response time test
5. Database connectivity
6. Recent deployments

Report:
‚úÖ What's healthy
‚ö†Ô∏è  What needs attention

   - Create git tag for this version

2. DEPLOY:
   - Commit and push changes
   - Trigger deployment (auto or manual)
   - Monitor deployment logs
   - Verify successful deployment

3. POST-DEPLOYMENT:
   - Test the update works
   - Check for new errors
   - Monitor for 10 minutes

```

### Command 9.3: Rollback Deployment

```
Railway Conductor: Rollback to previous deployment immediately.

Emergency rollback procedure:

1. Stop current deployment:
   railway down

2. Identify last working version:
   - Check git history
   - Find last successful deployment
   - Confirm version with me

3. Rollback:
   - Checkout previous commit
   - Deploy previous version
   - Or use Railway dashboard to redeploy

4. Verify rollback:
   - Check service is running
   - Test critical functionality
   - Monitor logs

5. Investigate original issue:
   - What went wrong?
   - How to prevent?
   - Fix for next deployment

Execute quickly, explain later.
This is an emergency procedure.
