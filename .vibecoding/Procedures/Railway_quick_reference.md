## ðŸ“‹ Pre-Deployment Checklist

**Before every deployment:**
- [ ] Code committed to Git
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] .env.example created
- [ ] .gitignore configured
- [ ] Tests passing locally
- [ ] Railway CLI authenticated

---

## ðŸ”§ Common Configuration

### package.json (Node.js)
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "build": "npm run compile"
  }
}
```

### Environment Variable Reference
```bash
# Reference another service's variable
DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
API_URL=${{backend.API_URL}}

# Reference shared variable
DOMAIN=${{shared.DOMAIN}}

# Railway-provided variables
PORT=${{PORT}}  # Auto-provided
```

### railway.json (Optional)
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "npm run build"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npm start",
    "healthcheckPath": "/health",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE"
  }
}
```

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### Build Failed
```bash
# Check build logs
railway logs --build

# Common fix: Install missing dependency
npm install [package] --save
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "Add missing dependency"
git push
```

### Deployment Failed
```bash
# Check deployment logs
railway logs --deployment

# Verify start command
cat package.json | grep "start"

# Ensure PORT is used
grep "process.env.PORT" server.js
```

### Can't Connect to Database
```bash
# Check database variables
railway variables | grep DATABASE

# Verify database service running
railway status

# Test connection locally
railway run npm start
```

### Environment Variable Not Loading
```bash
# Verify variable is set
railway variables

# Redeploy after setting variable
railway up

# Check if code loads dotenv (for local dev)
grep "dotenv" package.json
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Deployment Workflow

### Method 1: GitHub Auto-Deploy
```bash
1. git add .
2. git commit -m "Your message"
3. git push origin main
4. # Railway auto-deploys
5. railway logs  # Monitor
```

### Method 2: CLI Deploy
```bash
1. railway link [PROJECT_ID]
2. railway up
3. railway open  # View dashboard
```

## ðŸ’¡ Best Practices

**Security:**
- âœ… Use environment variables for secrets
- âœ… Never commit .env files
- âœ… Use sealed variables for sensitive data
- âœ… Rotate API keys regularly

**Performance:**
- âœ… Enable auto-sleep for dev environments
- âœ… Set usage limits
- âœ… Use connection pooling for databases
- âœ… Implement healthcheck endpoints

**Monitoring:**
- âœ… Check logs regularly: `railway logs`
- âœ… Monitor metrics in dashboard
- âœ… Set up deployment notifications
- âœ… Review usage and costs

## âš¡ Quick Deploy (New Project)

```bash
# 1. Login
railway login

# 2. Create project
railway init

# 3. Set environment variables

```

---

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Real-time logs
railway logs --follow

# Last 100 lines
railway logs | tail -n 100

# Search logs for errors
railway logs | grep -i error

# Check service health
railway status

# View metrics
