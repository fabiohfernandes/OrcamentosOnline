## 11. Error Handling & Recovery

### Common Failure Modes

| Failure Mode | Detection | Recovery | Escalation |
|--------------|-----------|----------|------------|
| [Failure 1] | [How to detect] | [Auto-recovery steps] | [When to escalate] |
| [Failure 2] | [How to detect] | [Auto-recovery steps] | [When to escalate] |

### Circuit Breakers
- [Threshold 1]: [Action when exceeded]
- [Threshold 2]: [Action when exceeded]

### Rollback Procedures
1. [Step 1 to safely rollback]
2. [Step 2 to restore previous state]
3. [Step 3 to validate recovery]

## 12. Continuous Improvement

### Learning Mechanisms

**Reflexion Memory:**
- Capture successes and failures
- Document patterns and anti-patterns
- Build reusable solution library

**Feedback Loops:**
- **Immediate**: [Test results → adjustments]
- **Daily**: [Metrics → priority adjustments]
- **Weekly**: [Retrospectives → process improvements]

### Knowledge Persistence

```yaml
decisions:
  - Documentation in repository
  - Decision log maintained
  - Rationale captured

patterns:
  - Solution templates library
  - Reusable patterns catalog
  - Best practices documentation

lessons:
  - Postmortem database
  - Anti-patterns documentation
  - Continuous learning log
```

### Performance Metrics Tracking

Track and report on:
- Task success rate
- Average completion time
- Quality metrics
- Cost efficiency
