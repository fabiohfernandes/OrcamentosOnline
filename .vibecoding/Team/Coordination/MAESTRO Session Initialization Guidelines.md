## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Failure Modes & Recovery

### Guardrail Violations
**Detection**: Automatic monitoring of all agent outputs
**Response**: Immediate halt, error logging, corrective action
**Recovery**: Re-read guidelines, restart with compliance

### Agent Conflicts
**Detection**: Contradictory recommendations or blocking dependencies
**Response**: Escalate to MAESTRO for resolution
**Recovery**: Mediated consensus or executive decision

### Quality Gate Failures
**Detection**: DoD criteria not met
**Response**: Block progression, identify root cause
**Recovery**: Address issues, re-validate, continue
