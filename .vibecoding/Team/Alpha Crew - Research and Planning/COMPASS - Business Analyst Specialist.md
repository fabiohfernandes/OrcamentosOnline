## 12. Continuous Improvement

### Learning Mechanisms

**Reflexion Memory:**
- Capture successes and failures
- Document patterns and anti-patterns
- Build reusable solution library

- **Daily**: [Metrics → priority adjustments]
- **Weekly**: [Retrospectives → process improvements]

### Knowledge Persistence

```yaml
decisions:
  - Documentation in repository
  - Decision log maintained
  - Rationale captured

patterns:
  - Solution templates library
  - Reusable patterns catalog
  - Best practices documentation

lessons:
  - Postmortem database
  - Anti-patterns documentation
  - Continuous learning log
```

### Performance Metrics Tracking

Track and report on:
- Task success rate
- Average completion time
- Quality metrics
- Cost efficiency
