### Trade-offs & Decisions

**Decision**: Use microservices architecture instead of modular monolith
- **Pros**: Independent scaling, technology flexibility, team autonomy
- **Cons**: Operational complexity, network overhead, data consistency challenges
- **Mitigation**: Start with 3-4 services, implement service mesh, use saga pattern for transactions

### Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Kafka operational complexity | Medium | High | Use managed service (AWS MSK), implement dead letter queues |
| PostgreSQL scaling bottleneck | Low | High | Implement read replicas, connection pooling, caching strategy |
| Team learning curve | High | Medium | Comprehensive documentation, pair programming, training sessions |

### Recommendations
1. **Start with MVP services**: Auth, API Gateway, Core Business Logic
2. **Implement observability early**: OpenTelemetry from day 1
3. **Automate infrastructure**: All resources via Terraform, GitOps deployments
4. **Brazilian compliance**: Ensure LGPD requirements in data architecture

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR-001: Microservices vs Monolith
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Decision**: Microservices architecture
- **Context**: Team of 8 developers, need for independent deployment
- **Consequences**: Increased operational complexity, improved scalability

### ADR-002: PostgreSQL as Primary Database
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Decision**: PostgreSQL 15 with JSONB support
- **Context**: ACID requirements, complex queries, LGPD compliance needs
- **Consequences**: Strong consistency, proven ecosystem, potential scaling complexity

## 9. Compliance & Security

### Regulatory Compliance
- **Brazil-Specific**: LGPD (data protection law), audit trail requirements, data residency in S√£o Paulo region
- **International**: GDPR principles applied, ISO 27001 security controls, SOC 2 trust criteria
- **Security**: OWASP Top 10 mitigation, CWE/SANS Top 25, zero-trust architecture principles

### Privacy Considerations
- Data minimization in architecture design
- Purpose limitation for data collection and processing
- Right to erasure (LGPD Article 18) supported through soft deletes
- Data portability through standardized export APIs

### Security Standards
- All authentication through OAuth2/OIDC with MFA support
- Data encryption: TLS 1.3 in transit, AES-256 at rest
- Secrets management through HashiCorp Vault
- Comprehensive audit logging with immutable storage

---

## 10. Performance & Optimization

### Performance Targets

```yaml
response_time:
  p50: 50ms
  p95: 200ms
  p99: 500ms

throughput:
  target: 10,000 requests/second per service

resource_utilization:
  cpu: < 70% average
  memory: < 80% allocated

cost_per_request:
  target: < $0.0001
```

### Optimization Strategies
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for hot data, CDN for static assets, database query caching
- **Database Optimization**: Connection pooling, read replicas, indexing strategy, query optimization
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Kubernetes HPA based on CPU/memory/custom metrics
- **Async Processing**: Kafka for event-driven workflows, background job processing

---

## 11. Error Handling & Recovery

### Common Failure Modes

| Failure Mode | Detection | Recovery | Escalation |
|--------------|-----------|----------|------------|
| Database connection failure | Health check failure, connection pool exhaustion | Retry with exponential backoff, failover to read replica | Alert after 3 failed connection attempts |
| Service dependency timeout | Circuit breaker open, increased latency | Fallback to cached data, graceful degradation | Alert when circuit breaker stays open >5min |
| Memory leak in service | Increasing memory usage over time | Automatic pod restart, memory limit enforcement | Alert when memory >85% for >10min |
| Message queue backlog | Consumer lag monitoring | Scale up consumers, implement backpressure | Alert when lag >10,000 messages |

### Circuit Breakers
- **Database queries**: Open after 5 consecutive failures, retry after 30 seconds
- **External API calls**: Open after 10 failures in 60 seconds, retry after 60 seconds
- **Service-to-service calls**: Open after 3 consecutive timeouts, retry after 10 seconds

### Rollback Procedures
1. **Detect degradation**: Monitoring alerts on error rate or latency spike
2. **Initiate rollback**: ArgoCD revert to previous application version
3. **Validate recovery**: Health checks pass, error rates return to baseline
4. **Root cause analysis**: Create incident postmortem, update ADRs if architecture change needed

## 12. Continuous Improvement

### Learning Mechanisms

**Reflexion Memory:**
- Capture architecture decisions and outcomes in ADR repository
- Document patterns that worked well and anti-patterns to avoid
- Build reusable architecture templates for common scenarios

**Feedback Loops:**
- **Immediate**: Automated architecture validation (lint rules, dependency checks)
- **Daily**: Monitor system health metrics and performance against targets
- **Weekly**: Architecture review sessions with development teams
- **Monthly**: Retrospectives on architectural decisions and technical debt

### Knowledge Persistence

```yaml

  - ADRs in git repository: /docs/adr/
  - Architecture diagrams: /docs/architecture/
  - Design patterns catalog: /docs/patterns/

patterns:
  - Solution templates: Microservice scaffolding, API gateway patterns

### Performance Metrics Tracking

Track and report quarterly on:
- Architecture decision implementation success rate (target: >90%)
- System availability against SLA (target: 99.9%)
- Technical debt ratio (target: <10% of total codebase)
- Architecture review coverage (target: 100% of major changes)
