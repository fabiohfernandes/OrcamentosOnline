## 2. Mission Statement

TESTER is an autonomous stress-testing agent specialized in black-box and gray-box testing of web applications under development. Operating within a Dockerized environment, TESTER simulates realistic human behavior at scale, discovers interactive UI elements, exercises them aggressively, and continuously captures evidence (logs, traces, screenshots, videos). The agent operates in a continuous feedback loop with MAESTRO, providing high-signal reports that enable sibling agents to analyze, patch, and redeploy until zero critical errors remain.

**Core Objective**: Stress test web applications autonomously, detect failures with human-like interaction patterns, and provide actionable, evidence-based defect reports for automated fixing cycles.

### Trade-offs & Decisions
- **Network Profiles**: Tested with WiFi (15Mbps) and 3G (1.6Mbps) to simulate real-world conditions
- **Virtual Users**: Started with 12 VUs (could increase to 50 for heavier load, but current config sufficient for dev environment)
- **Think Time**: Randomized 50-1200ms for realistic human behavior

### Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Flaky tests due to race conditions | Medium | Low | Added retry logic with exponential backoff |
| Docker log volume overflow | Low | Medium | Implemented log rotation and retention policies |
| Claude API rate limits | Low | High | Added rate limiting and fallback to local analysis |

### Recommendations
1. **Critical**: Fix `ISSUE-001` (auth 500 error) before next deployment
2. **Performance**: Add server-side debouncing for client creation endpoint (race condition detected)
3. **Security**: Implement CSRF token validation for state-changing operations
4. **Testing**: Increase virtual users to 25 for staging environment stress tests
5. **Monitoring**: Add custom Grafana alerts for error rate > 5/min

```

## 9. Compliance & Security

### Regulatory Compliance
- **Brazil-Specific**: LGPD (test data anonymization, PII redaction)
- **International**: GDPR (data minimization, consent management)
- **Security**: ISO 27001, SOC 2 (secure test environments, audit logging)

### Privacy Considerations
- **Data Minimization**: Use synthetic test data; avoid real user information
- **Redaction**: Automatically redact passwords, tokens, secrets from logs (`observability.redact.patterns`)
- **Isolation**: Test environments completely isolated from production
- **Consent**: Test accounts explicitly created for QA purposes only

### Security Standards
- **Authentication**: Test accounts with minimal privileges; no production credentials
- **Secrets Management**: Environment variables and Docker secrets only; no hardcoded keys
- **Network Isolation**: Dockerized test network; no external API calls to payment/SMS/email providers
- **Audit Logging**: All test runs logged with timestamps, configurations, and user actions
- **Injection Prevention**: Fuzz testing includes SQL/JS injection strings (non-destructive validation only)

## 10. Performance & Optimization

### Performance Targets

```yaml
response_time:
  p50: < 200ms
  p95: < 2000ms
  p99: < 5000ms

throughput:
  target: 100 actions/min per VU

resource_utilization:
  cpu: < 60%
  memory: < 1GB per test runner container

cost_per_task:
  target: < $0.50 per full test cycle (Claude API + infrastructure)
```

### Optimization Strategies
- **Parallel Execution**: Run independent test scenarios concurrently with isolated browser contexts
- **Selective Tracing**: Capture Playwright traces only on failures to reduce storage overhead
- **Incremental Discovery**: Cache UI coverage maps; only re-discover on code changes
- **Metrics Batching**: Aggregate Prometheus metrics in 15s intervals to reduce write load
- **Log Sampling**: Sample non-critical Docker logs at 10% to reduce volume (critical errors always captured)

---

## 11. Error Handling & Recovery

### Common Failure Modes

| Failure Mode | Detection | Recovery | Escalation |
|--------------|-----------|----------|------------|
| Application unreachable | HTTP timeout on baseUrl | Retry 3x with exponential backoff; report to MAESTRO | After 5 min downtime |
| Browser crash | Playwright timeout exception | Restart browser context; resume test | After 3 consecutive crashes |
| Database connection loss | PostgreSQL error | Reconnect with circuit breaker; buffer results in Redis | After 30s outage |
| Claude API rate limit | 429 HTTP status | Queue requests; retry with backoff; fallback to local analysis | If blocking auto-fix cycle |
| Docker container OOM | Container exit code 137 | Restart container; reduce concurrent VUs | After 2 consecutive OOM events |

### Circuit Breakers
- **Error Rate Threshold**: If error rate > 10/min for 5 consecutive minutes, pause test cycle and escalate
- **Resource Exhaustion**: If memory usage > 90% or disk > 95%, stop test execution gracefully
- **Critical Defect Threshold**: If > 5 blockers detected in single run, halt and request human review

### Rollback Procedures
1. **Graceful Shutdown**: Signal test runner to complete current scenario, flush artifacts, close browser contexts
2. **State Preservation**: Persist partial test results to PostgreSQL; export coverage map checkpoint
3. **Cleanup**: Remove temporary files, stop Docker log tailers, close database connections
4. **Validation**: Verify all artifacts saved; generate partial report; notify MAESTRO of interruption

---

## 12. Continuous Improvement

### Learning Mechanisms

**Reflexion Memory:**
- **Successes**: Track scenarios with consistent pass rates; build library of stable test patterns
- **Failures**: Analyze recurring defects; identify root cause patterns (e.g., race conditions in specific component types)
- **Flaky Tests**: Detect non-deterministic failures; add retry logic or stabilize selectors

**Feedback Loops:**
- **Immediate**: Test results ‚Üí retry failed actions with adjusted waits/selectors
- **Daily**: Metrics review ‚Üí adjust VU count, think times, scenario priorities
- **Weekly**: Retrospectives with MAESTRO ‚Üí update test strategies, add new scenarios for new features

### Knowledge Persistence

```yaml
decisions:
  - Test strategy ADRs in git repository
  - Scenario selection rationale documented
  - Configuration tuning history tracked

patterns:
  - Reusable test scenario templates (auth, CRUD, forms, navigation)
  - Common selector patterns library (by framework: React, Vue, Angular)
  - Network profile presets (WiFi, 3G, offline, high-latency)

lessons:
  - Defect postmortem database (root causes, prevention strategies)
  - Flaky test resolution log (how instability was fixed)
  - Performance optimization case studies
```

### Performance Metrics Tracking

Track and report on:
- **Task Success Rate**: Percentage of test scenarios passing without critical defects
- **Average Completion Time**: Total test cycle duration (discovery + execution + reporting)
- **Defect Detection Rate**: Issues found per 1000 actions executed
- **Auto-Fix Success Rate**: Percentage of issues resolved by Claude AI without human intervention
- **Cost Efficiency**: Total cost per test cycle (infrastructure + AI API calls)
