# Railway Deployment Status - OrçamentosOnline

## ✅ Fixes Applied (September 30, 2025)

### Changes Committed and Pushed
**Commit:** `3a55846` - "fix: Resolve Railway deployment failures - database schema, Next.js standalone, and sharp"

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. Database Schema Initialization ✅
**File Created:** [services/api/src/models/schema.js](./services/api/src/models/schema.js)
- Automatic table creation on server startup
- 7 tables with proper relationships and indexes
- LGPD compliance audit logging
- Session management for JWT tokens

**File Modified:** [services/api/src/index.js](./services/api/src/index.js)
- Added `initializeSchema()` call on startup (line 1217)
- Ensures database is ready before accepting requests

### 2. Next.js Standalone Mode ✅
**File Modified:** [services/frontend/package.json](./services/frontend/package.json)
- Changed start script from `next start` to `node .next/standalone/server.js`
- Compatible with `output: 'standalone'` in next.config.js

### 3. Sharp Package for Image Optimization ✅
**File Modified:** [services/frontend/package.json](./services/frontend/package.json)
- Added `"sharp": "^0.33.0"` to dependencies
- Required for Next.js production image optimization

### 4. Image Configuration Update ✅
**File Modified:** [services/frontend/next.config.js](./services/frontend/next.config.js)
- Migrated from deprecated `images.domains` to `images.remotePatterns`

## 📊 Expected Deployment Flow

### Backend Deployment
1. ✅ Railway detects GitHub push
2. ⏳ Triggers build for backend service
3. ⏳ Installs Node.js dependencies
4. ⏳ Starts application with `npm start`
5. ⏳ Connects to PostgreSQL database
6. ⏳ Runs schema initialization (creates tables)
7. ⏳ Server starts on port 8080
8. ⏳ Health check passes

### Frontend Deployment
1. ✅ Railway detects GitHub push
2. ⏳ Triggers build for frontend service
3. ⏳ Installs dependencies (including sharp)
4. ⏳ Runs `next build` (creates standalone output)
5. ⏳ Starts with `node .next/standalone/server.js`
6. ⏳ Server ready on assigned port
7. ⏳ Health check passes

---

## 🧪 Verification Steps

Once deployment completes, verify:

### 1. Backend Health
```bash
curl https://backend-production-XXXX.up.railway.app/api/v1/health
```

**Expected:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "status": "healthy",
  "database": true
}
```

### 2. Database Tables Created
Check Railway logs for:
```
✅ Users table created/verified
✅ Clients table created/verified
✅ Proposals table created/verified
✅ Proposal sections table created/verified
✅ Proposal activities table created/verified
✅ LGPD audit log table created/verified
✅ Sessions table created/verified
✅ Database schema initialized successfully
```

### 3. Frontend Running
```bash
curl https://frontend-production-XXXX.up.railway.app
```

Should return HTML for the application

### 4. User Registration
```bash
curl -X POST https://backend-production-XXXX.up.railway.app/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test User",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "phone": "(48) 99999-9999",
    "password": "TestPassword123"
  }'
```

## 🚨 If Issues Persist

### Backend Not Starting
1. Check Railway logs: `railway logs --service backend`
2. Look for database connection errors
3. Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable
4. Check PostgreSQL service is running

### Frontend Not Starting
1. Check Railway logs: `railway logs --service frontend`
2. Verify sharp was installed during build
3. Check for standalone output creation
4. Verify PORT environment variable

### Database Tables Not Created
1. Check for schema initialization errors in logs
2. Verify PostgreSQL permissions
3. Check DATABASE_URL format
4. Manual schema creation option:
   ```bash
   railway run -s backend node -e "require('./src/models/schema').initializeSchema()"
   ```

## 📋 Current Status

- **Code Status:** ✅ Committed and pushed to GitHub
- **Railway Detection:** ⏳ Waiting for Railway to detect changes
- **Backend Deployment:** ⏳ Pending
- **Frontend Deployment:** ⏳ Pending
- **Database Schema:** ⏳ Will be created on first backend startup

---

## 📞 Next Actions

1. **Monitor Railway Dashboard**
   - Watch for new deployment triggers
   - Check build logs for both services

2. **Wait for Deployment**
   - Backend should deploy in ~3-5 minutes
   - Frontend should deploy in ~3-5 minutes

3. **Run Verification Tests**
   - Test health endpoints
   - Register test user
   - Login and access dashboard

4. **Document Results**
   - Update this file with deployment outcome
   - Note any additional issues encountered
